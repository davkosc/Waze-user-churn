This repository contains select projects I have developed.

**Waze user churn project**

This project predicts user churn from the Waze app, using data provided by the Google Advanced Data Analytics professional certificate. The dataset represents several variables on user information since onboarding, and some gathered over the period of one month. The project is split into three notebooks (['Waze_user_churn_1_EDA'](https://github.com/davkosc/project-portfolio/blob/main/Waze_user_churn_1_EDA.ipynb)) with exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, (['Waze_user_churn_2_logistic'](https://github.com/davkosc/project-portfolio/blob/main/Waze_user_churn_2_logistic.ipynb)) which includes constructing and evaluating a logistic regression model, and 'Waze_user_churn_3_ml_modeling' which includes the same for two tree-based machine learning models (random forest and XGBoost).
