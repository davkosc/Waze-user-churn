# Waze user churn

This repository contains Python notebooks and datasets for a project meant to predict user churn from the Waze app. Data was provided by the Google Advanced Data Analytis professional certificate.

The dataset consists of several variables on user information since onboarding (joining the app), and some gathered over the period of one month. The project is split into three notebooks (['Waze_user_churn_1_EDA'](https://github.com/davkosc/project-portfolio/blob/main/Waze_user_churn_1_EDA.ipynb)) with exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, (['Waze_user_churn_2_logistic'](https://github.com/davkosc/project-portfolio/blob/main/Waze_user_churn_2_logistic.ipynb)) which includes constructing and evaluating a logistic regression model, and 'Waze_user_churn_3_ml_modeling' which includes the same for two tree-based machine learning models (random forest and XGBoost).
