# Portfolio

This repository contains select projects I have developed, primarily in the form of Jupyter Notebooks using Python.

**Waze user churn project**

This project predicts user churn from the Waze app, using data provided by the Google Advanced Data Analytics professional certificate. The dataset represents several variables on user information since onboarding, and some gathered over the period of one month. The project is split into two notebooks (['Waze_user_churn_1_EDA'](https://github.com/davkosc/project-portfolio/blob/main/Waze_user_churn_1_EDA.ipynb) with exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, and 'Waze_user_churn_2_modeling' which includes logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models to predict user churn).
